I am longing for the day
When I'll hold you close to me
In this moment now I can't seem to find a way
For me to tell you how you've captured me
Oh, you came to me
In peace and left me in pieces
Oh, you came to me
In peace and left me in pieces
Now I hopelessly wait
For my heart to heal and find its way
To you, to you
